# Machine Learning Program For Scam Sites
Used to see what is the best machine learning model for detecting if a website is a scam site or not (find stats in "old_stats.json") based on metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score), train/predict time, and minimal test. 

I was using a dataset, which was full of various lexical and host-based features extracted from the URL, domain, path, file, and query parameters, including counts of special characters and domain/server metadata.
